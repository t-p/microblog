MicroBlog
=========
- - - -
My attempt to write a microblog...  
You can test the application on heroku:  
http://smooth-river-747.heroku.com/  
All user handling is fully tested using Rspec.  
If you want to look at the code just clone this  
repository and follow these simple steps.

install bundle   
$ gem install bundle 

change into the microblog directory and install all the other gems using bundle   
$ bundle install

now you should be set to start the application   
$ rails server

you can look at my rspec stuff via   
$ rspec spec/
